## NeuralStyle Project

A modular neural style transfer toolkit developed in Python with clear modular separation for maintainability and extensibility.

### Key Features

* **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns for easy maintenance and extension
* **Batch Processing**: Automated multi-image and multi-style workflows for efficient processing
* **Configurable Pipeline**: Centralized hyperparameter management (image size, optimization steps, style/content weighting)
* **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly browser-based interface for uploading images and generating stylized outputs
* **Reproducible Environment**: Complete dependency specification and runnable entry points

### Technical Implementation

* **Deep Learning Framework**: PyTorch for neural network implementation
* **Style Transfer Algorithm**: Implementation of neural style transfer using pre-trained VGG networks
* **Web Interface**: Flask-based web application for user interaction
* **Optimization**: Custom loss functions balancing content preservation and style application
* **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation with version history via CHANGELOG
