## MapNavigation Project

A long-term maintained and updated project that combines OpenStreetMap data with Gaode Maps API to provide accurate routing and location search capabilities.

### Key Features

* **Hybrid Point Selection**: Manual map clicks or location search functionality
* **Detailed Route Information**: Comprehensive route display with turn-by-turn directions  
* **Multi-Road Type Support**: Support for different road types (motorway, trunk, etc.) with speed limit considerations
* **Real-time Updates**: Integration with live traffic data through Gaode Maps API
* **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for easy navigation planning

### Technical Implementation

* **Frontend**: Interactive web interface built with modern JavaScript frameworks
* **Backend**: Python-based API integration layer
* **Data Sources**: OpenStreetMap for detailed geographic data, Gaode Maps for real-time information
* **Algorithms**: Custom routing algorithms optimized for Chinese road networks

### Development Timeline

**December 2024 - Present**: Independent development with commitment to long-term maintenance and feature updates.
