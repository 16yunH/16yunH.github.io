## About Me

I am Yun Hong (Ê¥™Ëøê), a Computer Science student at **Fudan University** in Shanghai, China, and currently an exchange student at the **University of Texas at Austin**. My research interests span Machine Learning, AI-Driven Autonomous Driving, and Natural Language Processing.

*"So we beat on, boats against the current."*

## Current Research

### Research on ChatGPT-o1 Model Reproduction and Reflection Ability Improvement
**Research Assistant** | Fudan University Natural Language Processing Group  
*Sep. 2024 - Jun. 2025*

Under the guidance of Professor Xuanjing Huang, I work on introducing self-inspection and correction mechanisms into model reasoning to improve performance in complex tasks. My responsibilities include:
- Synthesis and training of self-critic data based on Llama3.1-8b-instruct
- Generating "reflection" answers from wrong to right using diverse strategies
- Constructing complex reflection paths based on tree search reasoning
- Performance evaluation using GSM8K test sets

### Learning Risk Map for Autonomous Driving in Partially Observable Environments
**Research Focus** | MagicLab, Fudan University  
*Oct. 2024 - May 2025*

Working under the guidance of Wenchao Ding on risk maps for autonomous driving:
- Engineered risk field representations using advanced spatiotemporal modeling techniques
- Developed realistic traffic scene generation leveraging diffusion models with gradient optimization  
- Designed a lightweight neural network for efficient risk prediction
- Research submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)
